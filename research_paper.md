# Research Paper

The LaTeX manuscript included with HeartLytics can be viewed inside the
application. The new light/dark theme system ensures figures and text in
the viewer adapt to the active theme for comfortable reading.
Even the login and signup pages now expose the theme toggle so readers
arrive at the paper with their preferred mode already applied.
The interface now uses an evenly spaced navigation bar and subtle motion
tokens that respect reduced-motion preferences.
