## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Heartlytics, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, email the core team at [security@heartlytics.app](mailto:security@heartlytics.app) with the following details:

1. A clear description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
2. The steps required to reproduce the issue, including proof-of-concept code if possible.
3. Any mitigating factors you have identified.
4. A preferred way to reach you for follow-up questions.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and aim to provide an initial assessment within **5 business days**. Throughout the process we will keep you updated as we work on a fix. When a resolution is ready, we will coordinate disclosure so the community has time to update before details are made public.

## Preferred Languages

We can review reports written in English.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, coordinated vulnerability disclosure activities that comply with this policy and applicable laws.
