# Heartlytics Frontend

A polished Next.js 14 workspace for the Heartlytics studio. It ships with TypeScript,
Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui-inspired primitives, Radix, Zustand state, Lucide icons, and
Framer Motion for subtle animation.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
pnpm run dev
```

The default route (`/`) showcases the refreshed studio experience:

- Marketing-grade hero and storytelling sections that reuse the shared design tokens.
- A streaming chat workbench with quick scenarios powered by a Zustand store.
- Tool execution cards that simulate agent integrations for rapid prototyping.

Every section is composed from reusable components so you can plug in live data or swap
layouts without rewriting the foundation.
