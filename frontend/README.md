# Heartlytics Frontend

A Next.js 14 playground for Heartlytics demos, built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui-inspired components, Radix primitives, Zustand state, and Lucide icons.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
pnpm run dev
```

The default route (`/`) showcases a streaming chat experience with reusable layout primitives and quick action prompts for rapid prototyping.
